-- postgres doesn't have describe functionality!
select column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length
from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name = '<name of table>';

-- for text searching use like
-- % represents wildcard
where name like 'M%'

-- 2 alternatives for not equals
where not department = 'Sports'
where department != 'Sports'

-- cannot use equality with nulls - need to use specific is operator
where email is not null
where email is null

-- can include list of values to check using in operator
where department in ('Sports', 'First Aid', 'Toys')

-- between is inclusive so will include someone making 80,000 and someone making 100,000
where salary between 80000 and 100000

-- order by defaults to ascending from smallest to largest value
-- specify desc if want to order largest to smallest value
order by employee_id desc;

-- unique list of all departments in table in alphabetical order
select distinct department
from employees
order by 1;

-- column aliases
select first_name as "First Name", last_name as "Last Name", salary as "Annual Salary"
from employees;
